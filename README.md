# uCalculator
uCalculator is a simple clone of iOS calculator app, built with
[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). The goal of building this app is to learn UI tricks by trying to copy layout of the existing app.

To try out this sample app, use the latest stable version
of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
You can clone this repository or import the project.
